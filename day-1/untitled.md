# Tools vs Techniques

## 

Tools versus techniques is similar to research scenarios where scientist distinguish between material and methods where materials are the objects and the methods are the manner in which the objects are utilized.

Tools are objects that are used following certain techniques to achieve an objective.

In Cyber security and in this course, tools rely on “techniques” which are descriptions of how we would use particular tools.

The ‘technique’ of the researcher is critical in being able to use the described ‘tools’ to repeat the use of the tool during analysis to achieve the desired outcome.

In order to optimize the results of using a particular tool, it is important to follow a technique.

Following technique is critical to analysis because it optimizes workflow, allows for predictable results, & minimizes the chance of operator error.
