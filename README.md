## A Note from Obscurity Labs

### Who are we?

Obscurity Labs is a veteran owned cybersecurity firm. Collaborating with public and private sector clients to solve their most difficult security challenges through a combination of contracting, consulting, analytics, cyber mission operations, threat emulation, technology, cybersecurity, engineering, advanced security research & development, and innovative expertise.

### What we do?

We provide cybersecurity engineering, management, and technology services to public and private sector organizations.

At Obscurity Labs, we pride ourselves in our unique ability to integrate comprehensive strategy and cutting edge security into any information operations environment. Within the ever evolving world of information technology, it is imperative that your organization take a proactive, holistic approach to information security operations.

By leveraging our comprehensive experience in implementing an Infrastructure & technology-agnostic approach, integrating real-world attacker tradecraft, security assessments, and training; we believe your organization will be armed with the technology, processes and policies necessary to win the ever-evolving battle to ensure the continuous availability and integrity of your organization’s information.

### Training Philosophy

As veteran members of both the Information Technology and Cyber Security fields we recognized many of the issues with training and certifications that plagues both communities. After conducting in-depth research and drawing from our own personal experiences we identified certain issues that were present across the board:

* Overpriced Individual Training Courses
* Courses with too broad of a scope for the course length
* Annual Fees, & CPE’s
* Poorly designed courses or courses that didn’t thoroughly teach specific topics

To address these issues we decided to create courses that thoroughly teach individual concepts from beginning to end, maintain a more than adequate course length, minimize the costs, eliminated CPE’s, & Annual Fees.  


## Course Summary

Actions taken by an adversary can be generally defined as a collection of TTPs and Tradecraft Core Concept \(TCCs\) to achieve an objective. SOC Immersion Training was designed to teach the core fundamentals of analysis and detection techniques. It will also identify and explain the critical data points that drive the creation of the forensic artifacts necessary for analysis. SOC Immersion Training will accomplish these course goals by providing labs comprised of well-designed detection & analysis capabilities with forensic evidence from multiple emulated advanced adversary attacks.

During this course, you will gain the knowledge to perform critical forensic techniques that are needed to adopt a sound analysis methodology, rather than mastering a tool set.

## Student Info

### Student Required Materials

* Student will bring a laptop and charger
* Student will need modern Linux, MacOS or Windows host install 
* Student will NOT need virtualization, it will be supplied

### Course Differentiators

* **Cyber Range:** Custom range with complete coverage into each of the key data points required to

  provide each student with access to a range representative of an enterprise security stack.

* **Lab Driven:** Course focused around labs, providing short blocks of instruction followed by instructor led demonstrations, then a student lab
* **Tangible Metrics:** Students will be able to decrease their mean time to detection and show

  improvements by determining the difference between their pre & post course statistics

* **Personnel:** Each course will be taught with an active Red Team and Blue Team SMEs
